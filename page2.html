                <h2>The Top Artificial Intelligence Technologies of 2021</h2>
                It won’t be wrong to say, the future of the world completely relies on the future of AI, which is undoubtedly very bright. There is no lack of advancements that AI made and today, it gained momentum. 
                In Automation Industry, Artificial Intelligence is not about increasing speed; it has improved safety, cost-effectiveness, predicative driving, and more. Furthermore, in businesses, system connectivity and resource sharing is the biggest need of the time, and AI has made its peace of mind.
                The quick resolution, Quick turnaround time, and On-time completion are the key benefits of implementing AI in the processes.

              <p>Artificial Neural Networks are computational models and inspire by the human brain.<br> Many of the recent advancements have been made in the field of Artificial Intelligence, including Voice Recognition, Image Recognition, Robotics using Artificial Neural Networks. Artificial Neural Networks are the biologically inspired simulations performed on the computer to perform certain specific tasks like –

                Clustering<br>
                Classification<br>
                Pattern Recognition<br>
                Artificial Neural Networks, in general – is a biologically inspired network of artificial neurons configured to perform specific tasks.
                
                These biological methods of computing are known as the next major advancement in the Computing Industry.</p>
                <p>What is a Neural Network?
                  The term ‘Neural’ has origin from the human (animal) nervous system’s basic functional unit ‘neuron’ or nerve cells present in the brain and other parts of the human (animal) body. A neural network is a group of algorithms that certify the underlying relationship in a set of data similar to the human brain. The neural network helps to change the input so that the network gives the best result without redesigning the output procedure. You can also learn more about ONNX in this insight.</p>
              
                  <p>Parts of Neuron and their Functions<br>
                    The typical nerve cell of the human brain comprises of four parts –
                    
                    Function of Dendrite<br>
                    It receives signals from other neurons.
                    
                    Soma (cell body)<br>
                    It sums all the incoming signals to generate input.
                    
                    Axon Structure<br>
                    When the sum reaches a threshold value, the neuron fires, and the signal travels down the axon to the other neurons.
                    
                    Synapses Working<br>
                    The point of interconnection of one neuron with other neurons. The amount of signal transmitted depends upon the strength (synaptic weights) of the connections.</p>
