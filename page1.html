          <h2 style="color: darkslategray;">Artificial intelligence (AI)</h2>
           <p>the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly
              associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing
              systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason,
               discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s,
                it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example,
                 discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. </p>

          <h2 style="color: darkslategray;">What is intelligence?</h2>
          <P>All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, 
            while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.
             What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus.</P>

             Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines,<br>
              especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP),<br>
               speech recognition and machine vision.<br>

             AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.<br>
             
             Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn<br>
              the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step<br>
               instructions for how to complete a specific task.<br>
             
             Reasoning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.<br>
             
             Self-correction processes. This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and<br>
              ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.<br>
             
             Advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence<br>
             Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies<br>
              are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much<br>
               faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.<br>
